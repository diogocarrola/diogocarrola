## Hello, World! 🌍

I'm **Diogo**, a 22-year-old self-taught **Software Developer** from **Portugal**. Passionate about **web development**, **AI** and **IoT**, I'm on a mission to create meaningful solutions that make the world a better place. 🌱

### 🚀 What I'm Up To
- 🌐 Building my **first Progressive Web App (PWA)** from scratch, designed to impact over **7,000 users**.
- 📚 Constantly learning and exploring new technologies, especially in **JavaScript**, **AI** and **IoT**.
- 🎤 Dreaming about being the **CEO of a big startup one day** (because hey, why not aim high? Plus, humor keeps me sane!) or maybe working at **@Google** someday too. 😄

### 🌟 Who I Am
